# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with React + TypeScript

### I decided to rewrite the React projects I had written before and put them on GitHub.
so this is the first one!
name of this repos starting with "react-".

clone this repo, cd to it's folder, open a terminal, and just type npm run dev!

Hope you enjoy it!
